    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
        At ZomnIA, we value your privacy. This policy explains what information we collect, 
        how we use it, and how we protect it. ZomnIA is designed to operate without collecting 
        personally identifiable data.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not request your name, email, or any personal data. The only content processed 
        is the dream text you write or the audio you narrate. This information is used exclusively 
        to generate interpretations through AI and is not stored on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Anonymous Dream Posting</h2>
    <p>
        The community inside ZomnIA is completely anonymous. No one can identify who posted a dream. 
        All posts are automatically moderated to prevent harmful or offensive content before appearing 
        publicly.
    </p>

    <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
    <p>
        ZomnIA only requests minimal permissions: microphone access to narrate dreams, and 
        notification permission to send optional updates. We do not use camera, contacts, 
        location, or any other additional permissions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Handling of Audio and Text</h2>
    <p>
        When you narrate a dream, the app temporarily converts the audio to text. We do not store 
        recordings or texts in permanent databases. Nothing is linked to identities, devices, 
        or accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Advertising and Premium Mode</h2>
    <p>
        ZomnIA uses ads to remain free. These ads may use anonymous device identifiers. You can 
        activate premium mode to remove ads. No additional purchases or donations are available.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We do not store sensitive data or private information. ZomnIA is designed to operate 
        without user accounts or personal databases.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this policy to reflect improvements or legal requirements. The latest 
        version will always be available inside the app.
    </p>
